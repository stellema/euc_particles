General Description: 

OFAM3 model output of u,v,w,temp,salt for years 1979-2014 and 2070-2101. Each file contains one month of daily data. Note that u and v have not been trimmed to match dimensions of w,temp,salt). Files were compressed using gzip -v --best, unless zipping files did not decrease file size by a reasonably amount (e.g. <1% file decrease). OFAM3 data is a subset over the tropical Pacific Ocean +/- 15 degrees of latitude between 120 and 295 degrees of longitude.
